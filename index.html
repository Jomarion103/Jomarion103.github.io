<p>You are a new student on UofSCs campus and you want to start networking with
    others, but you are having trouble connecting with people, or you are having a problem
    with finding things to do on campus. Our solution is to create an app that allows users to
    connect with their peers, professors, alumni, clubs, workplaces, etcâ€¦ on campus.</p>
